# Design Review 1

###This will take place in class on Friday, April 1

Details will be posted here soon

<!-- You will have **8 minutes** to present the following information:

- Elevator pitch - A brief (30-45 second) pitch of your project idea.
What is it? Why is it exciting?

- In-depth project description including:
  - system and infrastructure architecture diagrams.
  - UI Mockups (sketches/wireframes)

- Project roadmap with big picture features and a rough timeline -
In what order will you tackle things? How long do you expect each aspect to take?

- What are you the most worried about - The big unknowns, assumptions, showstoppers
in your project. What have you done so far to understand these better, what are your next steps?

There will be a few minutes at the end for questions and to collect feedback from the class and teaching team.
