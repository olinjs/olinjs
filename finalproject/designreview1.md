# Design Review 1

### Format
We’ll give you 10 min at the beginning of class to prepare, then the reviews will start at 3:30 in AC328 and three other classrooms in the AC. You’ll present to 1-2 other teams and 1-2 teaching team members, and you’ll have 15 minutes to do whatever will be most helpful for you moving forward -- get feedback or advice, do a codesign, do a code review... up to you. The flexibility we’re giving you means that we trust you to use the time productively.

### Goals
Here’s what we hope the design review will do for the class:
- Facilitate inter-team communication -- if another team is doing something similar to what you’re doing, we want you to have the opportunity to help and learn from each other.
- Act as a check-in so you have incentive to get moving on your project right away
- Encourage you to spend time up front thinking about longer-term architecture decisions

### Content
We’d like you to start out by explaining your idea so the other people in the room (another team or two and 1-2 teachers/ninjas) have context for what you’re doing.

Beyond that, you’re free to use the time however you think is best.

If you’re looking for ideas, we think it might be helpful to present on project challenges (maybe current challenges, maybe challenges you think you’ll encounter, maybe both). Here’s a definitely-not-exhaustive list of things you might be finding challenging:
- Application architecture
- Database models
- Deployment
- User auth and/or information security
- New libraries which you think might be tricky to use
- Sockets / multi-user logistics
- Project timeline, plan going forward
- User interface
- Team development practices

### Our Expectations
Each design review is 20% of your final project grade -- we’re looking for:
- Evidence that you’ve put meaningful thought into how to use the design review time to help you with your project.
- Evidence that you’ve done significant work so far
	- By design review 1 (4/1), we think the work will probably include the basic structure of your app, a detailed design, some initial progress on the hard parts of the app, a plan for the work you’re going to do in the future
	- By design review 2 (4/15), we think you should be close to an MVP.
