# Lesson 2 In-Class Exercises
(As before, weâ€™re not expecting you to finish all of these activities! Pick the ones which are interesting and challenging to you, and feel free to work with the people around you.)

## JavaScript Concepts:
- Break into groups of ~4 members. Each member is in charge of finding out about a specific javascript concept and writing a small [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) that demonstrates it.
  - Come back together and give quick whiteboard talks within your group -- teach the rest of the group about your concept.
  - Concepts:
    - First-Class and Higher Order Functions
    - Prototypes/Inheritance
    - Bind, Apply, Call
    - Closures

## Event Listeners:
- Much of web development is learning to react to events. As a first foray into event handling, write a small jsfiddle [like this](https://jsfiddle.net/too7t5dd/) that creates a simple html element and responds to an event of your choice. A list of possible events is available [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

## Functional Programming:
- Part of the power of JavaScript is that it is supports imperative (like C), object oriented (like C++ or Java), and functional (like Fortran or Lisp) programming paradigms. Its likely you've run into the first two through previous software classes, but if you are new to functional programming now is a great time to get an introduction
- Read one or more of the following (in increasing order of read time):
  - [A Practical Introduction To Functional Programming](https://medium.com/@riteshkeswani/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming-javascript-ba5bee2369c2#.z4n0g8oew)
  - [Introduction to Functional Javascript](https://medium.com/functional-javascript/introduction-to-functional-javascript-45a9dca6c64a#.nq16t3bdp)
  - [Eloquent Javascript 1st Ed Ch 6: Functional Programming](http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html)
- Use what you learned (do some of the following):
  - Discuss what you learned with a partner
  - Come up with a simple task such as displaying the current time. Write two small jsfiddles to complete the task: one in an object-oriented fashion, the other in a functional one.
  - Read through and understand the documentation for some of JavaScript's functional tools (for instance, `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()`) and practice using them in jsfiddle.

##Debugging Exercises
