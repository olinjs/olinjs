### Before Class 3 (Tuesday 1/26/16)

#### Assignment
Do the following readings:

###### Node Beginner Book
Read the Node Beginner Book (in `Public/+Courses/Olinjs16/`) up to page 58 (the section marked **Handling file uploads** — the methods used there are old and no longer relevant). This resource ties together a lot of what we covered in class 1 by implementing a basic web server in Node. You'll learn how Node handles browser requests — and how Node is unique — while flexing your newly acquired JavaScript muscle. You should follow along by writing and running the code examples given.

###### Style Guide
Read the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5). Try to incorporate these styles into your work in this class.

###### Optional Reading
This is a fun, well-written article on how naming conventions affect the way we think and code: [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html).

###### Submission
When you're finished, fill out [the Homework 2 submission survey](http://goo.gl/forms/yMmvIXtrsX).

#### Preclass Reading and Exercise
- Read the first three sections of the [Class 3 README](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs/tree/master/lessons/03-express-templates-mongo).  You will be learning about Express, a development framework that is often used together with Node. Follow along with the exercises in the Readme to create a "hello world" Express application. Make sure that you can access your application in a web browser and be ready to show it to the teaching team next class. Note that you only need to do exercises in sections up to and including *Organizing an Express Application* in order to create your "hello world" application.
