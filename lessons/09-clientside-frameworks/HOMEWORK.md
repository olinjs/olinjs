#### Assignment
Create a ToDo List App using a fronted framework, as for example shown [here](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/), using Angular. Think about what routes your API needs to include for this application to function. Your app should be able to:
- **Add** an item to the list
- **Edit** an item in the list
- **Save** an edit that took place in an item in the list
- **Remove** item from the list
- Keep a running count of the items to be completed
- Be able to separate/filter the items on the list:
	- All
	- Active
	- Completed
- Mark item as complete and append to "Completed" list
- Optional:
	- Undo edits
