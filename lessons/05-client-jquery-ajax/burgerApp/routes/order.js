// Shows a form which allows customers to create a new burger.
// There should be a checklist of all ingredients and their price.
// Out-of-stock ingredients should have a disabled checkbox (<input type="checkbox" disabled>)
// There should be a Submit button that will send the server the new order without refreshing the page.
// You may want to refer to the Mongo reading on Referencing vs. Embedding as you think about how you will store your data. You should give your customer a nice congratulatory message for completing their order (maybe a free cat picture since you're so good at that?!)
// A running counter of total cost: Should update whenever a new ingredient is added or removed.
