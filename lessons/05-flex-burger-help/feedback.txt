Homework Feedback:

Functionality:
- Completion: Most of the features work!! Nice job! You are missing the edit ability for the ingredients page. (15/20)
- Bug Free: The app does seem bug free. It's a good idea to remove your log statements when you are in production. (10/10)

Quality:
- Good Coding Practices: Good styling practices! It is pretty hard to have everything in one main.js, but now that we are using React, having different components is going to be a lot easier. (10/10)
- Readability: Functions and variables are named well, good comments and lines are not too long. Have comments in your routes though.(10/10)


Good work!!!!!!
