# If you're still working on the homework:

### Whiteboarding
- On the board, draw a diagram which represents how an AJAX request works. Make sure you represent the client, the server, get/post requests, responses, data which is passed from client to server and from server to client... and what else?
- On the board, list as many methods for client/server communication as you can and compare/contrast them.

### AJAX readings
- A couple of readings (in ascending order of read time), choose the ones that appeal to you.

### Adding HTML to a page using jQuery

### Real Life Selector Practice
- We are going to play around with the twitter homepage using jQuery
- First, open [twitter](https://twitter.com) in an incognito tab, you should see a grid of popular tweets
- Now lets open up the console and have some fun
    - Use the elements pane of the console to explore how the page is set up. What are the classes you could use to [**select**](https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/) all the tweets? A single tweet? The retweet count on a single tweet?
    - Change the [**text**](https://api.jquery.com/text/) content of all of the tweet
    - Attach a [**mouseover**](https://api.jquery.com/mouseover/) event to each of the tweets.
    - Select the [**first**](https://api.jquery.com/first/) tweet, change it so that so that it has 9001 likes and -10 retweets
    - [**clone**](https://api.jquery.com/clone/) the first tweet, change the image to be one of your choosing and add it back to the DOM [**before**](https://api.jquery.com/before/) the tweet you cloned

###Pre-Populating Your Database
Some of you have had questions about how to get data into your database as you work on developing your apps. There are two main methods we can suggest.

####Faking It
If you just want data in your database so you can play around with formatting your Handlebars templates or JQuery selectors, it is really easy to fake what your data would look like by creating an object to pass to Handlebars. The one caveat with this approach is that your database output might not look exactly like you expect, but once you have something that works with Handlebars, you can format the data from the database in the same pattern.

To implement this, you just pass your fake data object to Handlebars in `res.render`:

```javascript
res.render(‘ingredients’, {ingredients : [
  {name: 'Tomato',
   price: '1' },
  {name: 'Sriracha',
   price: '2' }
]});
```

Now you can play around with your fake data on the front end of your app until you are ready to move forward to working with a database.

#### Create An Add Route
You will eventually need a way to add initial information to your database for real. This will usually look a lot like the "new cat" route from your cat app. For the purpose of populating your database, you can make an array of random ingredient names and a random number generator and have your app save a randomly generated ingredient every time you go to your "new ingredient" route. Alternatively, you can hook a simple client-side "add ingredient" form up to the "new ingredient" route on the server. Hint: this would look a lot like the POST route from the class five readme, but with the added functionality of saving the data you receive in `req.body` to your database.

### Share your Problems
Show your group a problem you're trying to solve or a problem you think you solved in a particularly clever way. Get their feedback -- what did they do to solve the same problem? Do they understand things you don't, or vice versa? Do you have different mental models for the same thing?
