# Lesson 6 In-Class Exercises

(Weâ€™re not expecting you to finish all of these activities! Pick the ones which are interesting and challenging to you, and feel free to work with the people around you.)

### CSS Debugging Exercises

The file `debugging.css` is a good start to a CSS file, but it could definitely be improved to look a little nicer.  Take a look at `debugging.html` to see how it displays, and fix some of the CSS to make it better according to design principles.  Some things to start with:
- The text goes all the way to the end of the screen - doesn't look super good
- Not a lot of whitespace between the italic summary and the main body
- No formatting on the bullet points make them stick out into the whitespace
- Might look better if the start of the paragraphs on the italic sumamry and the main body were aligned
- The text in the main body is pretty squished - increase the space between lines for better visual?

### Make a Webpage According to Spec

Make a webpage for a simple blogging website using HTML and CSS/Sass, either locally or on [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).  It should have:
- A navbar at the top of the page
- A sidebar
- Blog posts (placeholders)

The sidebar:
- Think about what a sidebar should contain.  Links to blog entries?  About the author?  Should it scroll with the posts or stay fixed at the top of the page?

The blog posts:
- Assume every blog post has a banner picture, title, date, and content

Think about the design principles we talked about.  Think about using nice fonts and [web safe colors](http://websafecolors.info/).

### Re-create one of [these](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) Flexbox layouts

Philip Walton has desribed a varity of common css challenges that are now made significantly simpler thanks to flexbox. Give one or two of the examples a try.

### Add error handling to a previous app

We've noticed that a large portion of the cat apps had very little in the way of error handling. If you fall into that category, now would be a great time to go back and use some of the strategies laid out in the README to some of your old code.

### Lodash programming exercise

[Lodash](https://lodash.com) is a very useful utility library that can dramatically simplify your javascript. [Here](https://egghead.io/lessons/core-javascript-introduction-to-lodash) is a great introductory video that demonstrates how useful lodash can be.

Here is a [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/h9mkaxrz/4/) with inline comments describing the functionality of a program. Fill it it in.

### Modularize some previous non-modular code you've written

Now that you have learned so much on the burger app and in the most recent README, it would be a great time to go back to old projects and refactor it to be more modular.
