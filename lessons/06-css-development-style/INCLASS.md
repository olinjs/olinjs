### CSS Debugging Exercises

The file `debugging.css` is a good start to a CSS file, but it could definitely be improved to look a little nicer.  Take a look at `debugging.html` to see how it displays, and fix some of the CSS to make it better according to design principles.  Some things to start with:
- The text goes all the way to the end of the screen - doesn't look super good
- Not a lot of whitespace between the italic summary and the main body
- No formatting on the bullet points make them stick out into the whitespace
- Might look better if the start of the paragraphs on the italic sumamry and the main body were aligned
- The text in the main body is pretty squished - increase the space between lines for better visual?

### Make a Webpage According to Spec

Make a webpage for a simple blogging website using HTML and CSS/Sass.  It should have:
- A navbar at the top of the page
- A sidebar
- Blog posts (placeholders)

The sidebar:
- Think about what a sidebar should contain.  Links to blog entries?  About the author?  Should it scroll with the posts or stay fixed at the top of the page?

The blog posts:
- Assume every blog post has a banner picture, title, date, and content

Think about the design principles we talked about.  Think about using nice fonts and [web safe colors](http://websafecolors.info/).
