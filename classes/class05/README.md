## Git Best Practices - Assignment

In the real world (and in this class), it's not good practice to commit directly to the `master` branch. If a real project is under version control, committing a bug to `master` could break live code. The `master` branch is generally reserved for code that has been tested and shown to work in a branch.

1. Create a new branch on your `olinjs` repository.

  ```bash
  $ git checkout -b branchname
  ```

2. Commit something on the branch.
3. Pull request that branch to `master` on your fork of `olinjs/olinjs` on GitHub.
4. We will comment on the pull request and give you a grade (out of 1).
5. We will close the pull request.

## .gitignore

This is the directory structure of the `olinjs` repo.

```bash
.
├── .git
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── classes
├── finalproject
├── lab1
├── lab2
└── lab3

6 directories, 2 files
```

The `.gitignore` file lives in the root directory of the git repository. Each line is a pattern for a file to ignore.

###### .gitignore

```bash
# Logs
**/logs
**/*.log

# Runtime data
pids
**/*.pid
**/*.seed

# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover
**/lib-cov

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
**/coverage

# Grunt intermediate storage (http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files)
**/.grunt

# node-waf configuration
**/.lock-wscript

# Compiled binary addons (http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)
**/build/Release

# Dependency folders
**/node_modules

# Debug log from npm
**/npm-debug.log

# For Mac users without global gitignore
# http://islegend.com/development/setting-global-gitignore-mac-windows/
**/.DS_Store
```

This is worth perusing but we won't cover it in detail now. Your `.gitignore` can be as simple as:

###### .gitignore

```bash
node_modules
```

Which will ignore the `node_modules` folder — standard for a Node repository.
