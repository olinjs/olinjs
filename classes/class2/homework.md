# Homework 2

## Reading

Read the Node Beginner Book (in `Public/+Courses/Olinjs15/`) up to page 58 (the section marked **Handling file uploads** — the methods used there are old and no longer relevant). This resource ties together a lot of what we covered in class 1 by implementing a basic web server in Node. You'll learn how Node handles browser requests — and how Node is unique — while flexing your newly acquired JavaScript muscle. You should follow along by writing and running the code examples given.

## Optional Reading

This is a fun, well-written article on how naming conventions affect the way we think and code: [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html).
