##Course Description
Olin.js is a project oriented approach to learning modern web application development. With server and client technology advancing so rapidly, the modern website looks very different from that of even a few years ago, and will only become a bigger part of lives in the near future. Olin.js will quickly introduce and familiarize students with node.js as a web server framework and ES5 JavaScript as a responsive client-side language. Along the way students will learn the basic layout of the web, how to deploy and maintain large applications, important development strategies, skills, and technologies, and how to design and manage software projects. Students will conclude the course by putting their knowledge and skills to the test through developing their own web applications.
